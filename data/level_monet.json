	"intro": "Welcome to the terrace, darling - where only those with truly refined vision may tread.
	Today's diversion: we are in search of a most elusive hue - Steel Blue, mind you, not some pedestrian knockoff.
	
	Among our well-accessorized circle sits one gentleman with a hat bearing a strip of that very color.  
	Your task is to spot him. Do take care - the light shifts, and not all eyes are properly trained in nuance.  
	
	Of course, a misstep will only reveal how dreadfully ordinary your perception is.",
	
	"success_msgs": [
		"Ah, there you are.",
		"At last, someone whose eyes aren't bound by vulgar prisms.",
		"Steel Blue, of course. Quiet strength.",
		"An icy whisper of intellect.",
		"Precisely what Monet might have chosen for a sky just before dusk.",

		[
			"Dark Lavender, you say?",
			"Well, it's not everyone's taste, but I find it rather soulful."
		],
		[
			"Dark Slate Blue?",
			"Hm. A bit severe for some, perhaps. But it's exquisitely brooding, no?"
		],
		[
			"Amethyst?",
			"Charming. Not for amateurs, certainly. But it sings under proper lighting."
		],
		[
			"Medium Purple?",
			"I've been told it's optimistic. Perhaps too optimistic for your eye?"
		],
		[
			"Cornflower Blue?",
			"A darling shade. Youthful, but not unrefined."
		],
		[
			"Dodger Blue?",
			"Yes, it's bright. But one must be bold sometimes, don't you think?"
		],
		[
			"Lime Green?",
			"Oh, how refreshing. It practically hums with irreverence."
		],
		[
			"Olive Green?",
			"Rooted. Earthy. You need sophistication to appreciate its restraint."
		],
		[
			"Crimson?",
			"Dramatic, yes. But then again, some of us can pull it off."
		],
		[
			"Firebrick?",
			"Oh, the depth! It broods, it burns... in a very controlled way, of course."
