	Everyone's stickin' to the plan, wearin’ their helmets, and mindin’ their business — well, almost everyone. 
	
	One fella’s gone completely off the rails. He’s makin’ a mess, doin’ who-knows-what, and causin’ trouble like it's his job. 
	Your task: find the one guy who's clearly not doin’ what he’s supposed to.

	Just try not to get hit by a flying wrench while you're at it.",
