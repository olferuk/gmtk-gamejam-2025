	They're looking for someone who looks like Harry Potter. 
	Yeah, like, *the* Harry Potter, you know?

	The thing is, a bunch of students showed up, all hoping it's them.
	Everyone's awkward, everyone's stressed... and everyone’s hyper-aware of, like, every pimple on their face.

	But *one* guy — one *suspiciously perfect* wizardy guy — he’s not here by accident.
	Your job is to find him before someone has a full-on anxiety spiral.",

		"Okay, fine, you got me.",

			"Wait—me? No no no.",

		[
			"I do *have* glasses, yes...",
			"But I’m nearsighted *and* emotionally fragile."

		[
			"Me? A wizard? I panic ordering coffee.",

		[
			"My mom says I’m handsome 'in good lighting'.",

		[
			"Wait, there’s a camera?",
			"Okay I’m gonna throw up."
		],
		[
			"These aren’t robes, it’s laundry day.",
			"And this pimple’s basically glowing—no magic required."
		],
		[
			"Honestly, I was just looking for the library.",
			"But now I feel deeply judged."

		[
			"Is it the scarf? It’s not even Gryffindor colors!",
			"Also, my skin is *so* oily right now."
